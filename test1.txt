GEMM Kernel Optimization Techniques
After benchmarking your naive GEMM kernel, here are key optimization techniques to improve performance:

1. Shared Memory Tiling
The naive kernel suffers from poor memory access patterns. Each thread reads from global memory multiple times, creating high memory traffic.

Solution: Use shared memory to create tiles that are cooperatively loaded by thread blocks.

cuda
__global__ void sgemm_shared(int M, int N, int K, float alpha, float *A, float *B, float beta, float *C) {
    // Define shared memory tiles
    __shared__ float As[32][32];
    __shared__ float Bs[32][32];
    
    // Load tiles into shared memory
    // Compute matrix multiplication using tiles
    // Store results back to global memory
}
Expected speedup: 2-5x depending on matrix size

2. Memory Coalescing
The naive kernel's memory access pattern for matrix B is not coalesced, causing inefficient memory transactions.

Solution: Transpose matrix B or use a different indexing scheme.

cuda
// Original access pattern (non-coalesced for B):
tmp += A[x * K + i] * B[i * N + y];

// Improved access pattern (transpose B first):
tmp += A[x * K + i] * B_transposed[y * K + i];
Expected speedup: 1.5-3x

3. Loop Unrolling
The inner loop can be unrolled to reduce loop overhead and enable better instruction scheduling.

cuda
float tmp = 0.0;
#pragma unroll 4
for (int i = 0; i < K; i += 4) {
    tmp += A[x * K + i] * B[i * N + y];
    tmp += A[x * K + (i+1)] * B[(i+1) * N + y];
    tmp += A[x * K + (i+2)] * B[(i+2) * N + y];
    tmp += A[x * K + (i+3)] * B[(i+3) * N + y];
}
Expected speedup: 1.2-1.5x

4. Register Blocking
Each thread can compute multiple output elements, keeping intermediate results in registers.

cuda
// Instead of 1 thread computing 1 element:
// Have 1 thread compute a 2x2 block of elements
float c00 = 0.0f, c01 = 0.0f, c10 = 0.0f, c11 = 0.0f;
Expected speedup: 1.5-3x

5. Double Buffering
Overlap computation with memory loading by using double buffering.

cuda
__shared__ float As[2][32][32];
__shared__ float Bs[2][32][32];

// Load first tile
// While computing on first tile, load second tile
// Alternate between tiles
Expected speedup: 1.2-1.5x

6. Tensor Cores (For Volta+ GPUs)
Modern NVIDIA GPUs have Tensor Cores that can accelerate matrix operations.

cuda
// Use WMMA (Warp Matrix Multiply Accumulate) API
#include <mma.h>
using namespace nvcuda::wmma;
Expected speedup: 3-8x

7. Use cuBLAS Library
For production use, consider using NVIDIA's highly optimized cuBLAS library:

cuda
#include <cublas_v2.h>

// Initialize cuBLAS
cublasHandle_t handle;
cublasCreate(&handle);

// Call SGEMM
cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, 
            N, M, K, &alpha, B, N, A, K, &beta, C, N);

// Destroy cuBLAS handle
cublasDestroy(handle);
Expected speedup: 5-20x over naive implementation

Performance Analysis Checklist
When analyzing your benchmark results, consider these performance aspects:

Arithmetic Intensity: FLOPS/Byte ratio
Memory Bound vs. Compute Bound: Is your kernel limited by memory bandwidth or computational throughput?
Occupancy: Are you efficiently using all SMs on the GPU?
Instruction Mix: Balance of arithmetic vs. memory access instructions
Cache Efficiency: L1/L2 cache hit rates (use Nsight Compute for this)
Remember that optimization techniques should be applied incrementally, measuring the performance impact of each change.
